# Stone-Paper-Scissor Game in C++

## Introduction

This is a simple implementation of the classic Stone-Paper-Scissor game in C++. The game allows a user to play against a computer. For simplicity, the computer's choice is manually input by the user. This project is designed to demonstrate basic C++ programming concepts such as input/output, arrays, and conditional statements.

## Features

- Simple text-based interface.
- User inputs their choice (Stone, Paper, or Scissor).
- Computer's choice is manually entered for testing and demonstration purposes.
- Determines the winner based on the rules of Stone-Paper-Scissor.
- Displays the result of each game round.

## Code Complexity

The code is straightforward and easy to understand, making it suitable for beginners. It includes:

- **Input/Output Operations**: Using `cin` and `cout` for user interaction.
- **Array**: Storing the game choices (`Stone`, `Paper`, `Scissor`) in an array for easy access.
- **Conditional Statements**: Determining the winner based on the rules of the game.
- **Input Validation**: Ensuring the user and computer inputs are within the valid range.
